### Hello there, I'm Colm Doyle...

![On stage during WeAreDevelopers 2018](https://github.com/colmdoyle/colmdoyle/blob/main/on-stage-cropped.jpeg?raw=true)

I currently lead the Developer Advocacy team at [Slack](https://slack.com).

Before that I was an early employee at [Kitman Labs](https://kitmanlabs.com), where I managed the Engineering team, and a founding member of the Developer Support Engineering team at [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com), where I helped build the Dublin and Menlo Park teams before moving into the Product Engineering organization. I also took part in any number of side projects, like [hacking the NASDAQ button](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/how-facebook-hacked-the-nasdaq-button/) and [encouraging people to vote in elections](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-2012-election-day-through-the-facebook-lens/10151181043778859/).

All of these jobs reflect what I love doing - making great software and helping other developers make great software.

In my spare time, I enjoying building civic-minded software like [Who is my TD](http://www.whoismytd.com/), which is also open sourced as [Pobal](https://github.com/colmdoyle/pobal).
